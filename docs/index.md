## What is Oumi OSS (Open Source Stack)?

Oumi OSS is an open-source platform designed for ML engineers and researchers who want to train, fine-tune, evaluate, and deploy foundation models. Whether you're fine-tuning a small language model on a single GPU or training a 405B parameter model across a cluster, Oumi OSS provides a unified interface that scales with your needs.

**Who is Oumi OSS for?**

- **ML Engineers** building production AI systems who need reliable training pipelines and deployment options
- **Researchers** experimenting with new training methods, architectures, or datasets
- **Teams** who want a consistent workflow from local development to cloud-scale training

**What problems does Oumi OSS solve?**

- **Fragmented tooling**: Instead of stitching together different libraries for training, evaluation, and deployment, Oumi OSS provides one cohesive platform
- **Scaling complexity**: The same configuration works locally and on cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure, Lambda Labs)
- **Reproducibility**: YAML-based configs make experiments easy to track, share, and reproduce

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10+, pip. GPU recommended for larger models (CPU works for small models like SmolLM-135M).

Install Oumi OSS and start training in minutes:

```bash
# Install with GPU support (or use `pip install oumi` for CPU-only)
pip install oumi[gpu]

# Train a model
oumi train -c configs/recipes/smollm/sft/135m/quickstart_train.yaml

# Run inference
oumi infer -c configs/recipes/smollm/inference/135m_infer.yaml --interactive
```

For detailed setup instructions including virtual environments and cloud setup, see the {doc}`installation guide <get_started/installation>`.

## What will you build?

Oumi OSS provides a unified interface across the entire model development lifecycle. The workflows below cover training, evaluation, inference, data synthesis, hyperparameter tuning, and cloud deployment—all driven by YAML configs that work identically on your laptop or a multi-node cluster.
